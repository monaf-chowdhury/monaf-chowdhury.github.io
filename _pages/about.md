I am a Research Assistant at the [MAIM Lab](https://www.maimlab.com/) of Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering in the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently, I am working on a [Wellcome Leap - In Utero](https://wellcomeleap.org/inutero/) funded project (Title: Translation of a Wearable Fetal Movement Monitor towards Stillbirth Prevention) collaborating with University College Dublin to develop a wearable device to monitor fetal movements to cut stillbirth rates.

Recently, I graduated from the University of Dhaka in Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering, supervised by [Dr. Md Mehedi Hasan](https://www.du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/HSS/4706). My fourth year thesis project was on "Enhancing UAV Based Human Action Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach".

Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.png` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
