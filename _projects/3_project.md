I am working on the [CAPTURe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to perform amodal countingâ€”inferring the number of occluded objects based on visible patterns. This task reflects critical spatial reasoning skills that current VLMs largely lack. 

My goal is to develop a system that improves counting accuracy under occlusion by enhancing pattern recognition, integrating visual and textual cues, and exploring hybrid approaches such as inpainting pipelines, coordinate extraction, or reasoning modules.
